\par \proplabel{Equivalency of product states and Schmidt number 1}:
%
Suppose $\ket{\psi} = \ket{\psi_A} \ket{\psi_B}$.
%
Then, via Gram-Schmidt, an orthonormal basis can be chosen  to contain $\ket{\psi_A}$ and $\ket{\psi_B}$ for spaces $A$ and $B$, respectively.
%
Under this basis, $\ket{\psi}$ will have a Schmidt number of 1.
%
\par On the other hand, if $\ket{\psi}$ has a Schmidt number of 1, then it is trivially a product state.
%
\par \proplabel{Equivalency of product states and pure state reduced operators}:
%
\begin{align*}
\trB{\kb{\psi}{\psi}} = \trB{\kb{\psi_A}{\psi_A} \otimes \kb{\psi_B}{\psi_B}} = \kb{\psi_A}{\psi_A} \braket{\psi_B|\psi_B} = \kb{\psi_A}{\psi_A} \\
\trA{\kb{\psi}{\psi}} = \trA{\kb{\psi_A}{\psi_A} \otimes \kb{\psi_B}{\psi_B}} = \braket{\psi_A|\psi_A} \kb{\psi_B}{\psi_B} = \kb{\psi_B}{\psi_B}
\end{align*}
%
So $\ket{\psi}$ being a two-system product state is equivalent to both its reduced operators being pure states.
